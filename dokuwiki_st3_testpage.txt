And Indicate that we don't want this page added to the TOC: ~~NOTOC~~

And indicate that we don't want this page to be cached: ~~NOCACHE~~

Note that both ~~NOTOC~~ and ~~NOCACHE~~ are highlighted even though they are not on lines of their own. Should we allow this??

==== INLINE STYLE TESTING ====

=== Bold, Italic, Monospace ===

This paragraph of text contains **bold** text, and //italic// text, and ''monospaced'' text.

If we have some //italic containing an url (http://harpanet.com)// then the double-slash in the url shouldn't cancel the italic.

=== Combinations ===

We have ''monospace with **bold** and //italic// within it.''
or **bold with ''monospace'' and //italic// within it.**
or //italic with ''monospace'' and **bold** within it.//

=== Emoticons ===

LOL
FIXME    or FIXME!
DELETEME or DELETEME!

8-) 8-O :-( :-) =) :-/ :-\ :-? :-D :-P :-O :-X :-| ;-) ^_^ :?: :!:

==== CODE BLOCKS ====

<code>
    //some generic code
</code>

<file php>
    //some php code using <file> tag
</file>

<code php file.php>
    // some php code with filename specified
    $var = 'some text';
</code>

  // and some code with just an indent (note: // not identified as italics)
  $this='is an example';

  * this is not code // it is a bullet point // so italics work
