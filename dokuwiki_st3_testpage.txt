Next, we will show a 'separator' line...

And Indicate that we don't want this page added to the TOC: ~~NOTOC~~

And indicate that we don't want this page to be cached: ~~NOCACHE~~

Note that both ~~NOTOC~~ and ~~NOCACHE~~ are highlighted even though they are not on lines of their own. Should we allow this??

==== INLINE STYLE TESTING ====

=== Bold, Italic, Monospace, Raw (nowiki) Text ===

This paragraph of text contains **bold** text, and //italic// text, and ''monospaced'' text and %%raw%% text.

If we have some //italic containing an url (http://harpanet.com)// then the double-slash in the url shouldn't cancel the italic.

Raw text <nowiki>can also be //identified// by the <nowiki> tags</nowiki>.

=== Combinations ===

We have ''monospace with **bold** and //italic// within it.''
or **bold with ''monospace'' and //italic// within it.**
or //italic with ''monospace'' and **bold** within it.//

We also have %%RAW TEXT //with no italic// **or bold**
or ''monospaced'' which continues until closed%% like this.

FIXME! BUT, all sorts of problems with raw text inside italics if the raw text contains the double-slash italic markers...
But what about //italics with %%raw // text %%inside it//?     (%% this closing raw-text marker is temporary, it cancels the problematic effects)
DokuWiki shows the raw text in italics, as above, but the **double-slash** in the raw text does not cancel the italics. How to FIXME?
FIXME! The same problems occur with **bold** or ''monospace'' markers if %%raw text with ** or '' %% is inserted into them!

=== Emoticons ===

LOL
FIXME    or FIXME!
DELETEME or DELETEME!

==== CODE BLOCKS ====

<code>
    //some generic code
</code>

<file php>
    //some php code using <file> tag
</file>

<code php file.php>
    // some php code with filename specified
    $var = 'some text';
</code>

  // and some code with just an indent (note: // not identified as italics)
  $this='is an example';

  * this is not code // it is a bullet point // so italics work
