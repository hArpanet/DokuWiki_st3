And Indicate that we don't want this page added to the TOC: ~~NOTOC~~

And indicate that we don't want this page to be cached: ~~NOCACHE~~

Note that both ~~NOTOC~~ and ~~NOCACHE~~ are highlighted even though they are not on lines of their own. Should we allow this??

==== INLINE STYLE TESTING ====

=== Bold, Italic, Monospace ===

This paragraph of text contains **bold** text, and //italic// text, and ''monospaced'' text.

=== Combinations ===

We have ''monospace with **bold** and //italic// within it.''
or **bold with ''monospace'' and //italic// within it.** FIXME! (italics not in bold)
or //italic with ''monospace'' and **bold** within it.// FIXME! (bold not in italics)

== URL tests ==

Do we have problems with //italic with an url within it (http://harpanet.com)// oops!// FIXME! (url double slash closes italics)
Or even ''monospaced text with an url like http://harpanet.com'' which doesn't close the monotext or italics, oops! FIXME!


=== Emoticons ===

LOL
FIXME    or FIXME!
DELETEME or DELETEME!
